## Useage

To install the `copier` tool with [uv] run:

uv tool install copier --with copier-templates-extensions
```

To initialize a new repository with the `copier` template run the following command:

```console
copier copy --trust "gh:npikall/py-bootstrap" path/to/project/
```

You will be prompted and then your repo will be setup.

After you have just used the `copier` to create this repo, you might want to run the following commands:

- `just init` to initialize a `git` repository
- `just venv` to create a virtual environment
