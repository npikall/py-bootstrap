## First Steps

After you have just used the `copier` to create this repo, you might want to run the following commands:

- `just init` to initialize a `git` repository
- `just venv` to create a virtual environment

## Development

### Pre-Commit Hooks

The Pre-commit Hooks will lint and format your code, aswell as running some checks.

```console
just hooks
```

### Quality Assurance

By default cody quality checks (formatter, linter and type-checker) are inplace, via `Github Actions` and/or `GitLab CI/CD`,
which does the same as the `pre-commit` hooks.

Additionally the same code quality checks can be run manually via:

```console
just check
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The configuration for the linter, the formatter and the typechecker can be done in the `pyproject.toml` file.
> By default ALL Linting Rules are enabled. If some rule are not desired in the project use the `exclude` field to disregard them.

### Docs

Further more there are example `docs` in this repository, which you can use as a startingpoint for your code documentation.
Run the following command to start serving your documentation locally:

```console
just docs
```
